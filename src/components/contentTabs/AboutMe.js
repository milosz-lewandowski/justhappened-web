                gaining knowledge and skills in the field of

                sportsman and a developer. I am full of energy,
                always ready to face new challenges. I enjoy
                working with people. My ideal job is one that
                connects teamwork and challenging tasks. My
                working style: creativity and cooperation to
                meet the project goals.
